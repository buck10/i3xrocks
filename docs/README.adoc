= {progname}

This project is a tracking fork of link:https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks[i3blocks] which changes two things:

1. The name of the program is i3xrocks instead of i3blocks.
2. The config file can resolve Xresource dependencies if prefixed with `resource:`.  For example, if you have 
a Xresource named "blockColor" then you can load that into i3xrocks via:

---
color=resource:blockColor

---

Otherwise this aims to be identical to i3blocks.  Please refer to the upstream project for documentation.

Special thanks to link:https://github.com/Airblader[@Airblader] for link:https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks/issues/198#issuecomment-238035596[his patch], without which I would not have been able to make this change.
